# 👋 Hi, I'm Nandini Kumari

Hi! I'm Nandini — a final year B.Tech CSE student who enjoys building clean and user-friendly websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

And starting my journey with **React**, **PHP**, and **WordPress** to move toward full-stack development and open-source contribution.

This GitHub profile reflects my hands-on learning journey. I'm actively working on small web projects and constantly trying to improve my code and understanding.
